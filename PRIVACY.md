# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 12, 2025

## Data Collection
**Kumaflow - Webflow UI Localization** does not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal information.

## Data Storage
The extension uses your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync`) solely for the purpose of saving your user preferences:
- Selected Language
- Enabled/Disabled State
- Configuration settings (e.g., Strict Matching mode)

This data never leaves your browser and is not accessible to the developer or any third parties.

## External Services
The extension fetches translation files (JSON) from the following Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to ensure you always have the latest translations:
- Cloudflare Pages (`webflow-ui-localization.pages.dev`)
- jsDelivr (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`)

These requests are for static JSON files only and do not transmit any user data.
