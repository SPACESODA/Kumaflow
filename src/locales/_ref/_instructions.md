## Instructions for AI

You are assisting me with editing the locale JSON files.
Read these instructions carefully.

General instructions:

1. Do not create or translate the exact same string (also known as terms or nodes) multiple times in a JSON file.
2. Save the translated strings in the locale JSON files with correct formatting.
3. DO NOT translate the words specified in `src/locales/_ref/_no_translate.md`. These are mostly brand names and Webflow terminology. Please use your judgment when handling translations.
4. When updating existing JSON files, please also check the `_new_strings.md` file for new strings.

About translation:

1. Translate with common sense and an awareness of the context and knowledge of modern web design.
2. Ensure consistency in the translations. Review the translations in the JSON files to understand the big picture and the overall nuances.
3. Make sure the translations are accurate and make sense in context. They should accurately reflect the UI nuances of Webflow with a strong focus on contextual accuracy.

Editing the locale JSON files:

1. Translate the missing strings in the JSON files according to my instructions.
2. DO NOT change the existing translations, instead, take them as reference for translating the missing strings.
3. Use the translations in zh-TW.json as references for translating the missing strings in zh-CN.json (但仍要注意使用簡體中文世界中或現代行業中比較流行的表達方式).
4. Ensure that the JSON files are valid and have good formatting. Perform a final check after updating the JSON files.
