## Instructions for AI

Read these instructions carefully.

You are assisting me with editing the locale JSON files:

1. Do not create or translate the exact same string (also known as terms or nodes) multiple times in the JSON files.
2. Save the translated strings in the locale JSON files with correct formatting.
3. Do not translate the words specified in `src/locales/_ref_ai/_no_translate.md`. These are mostly brand names and Webflow terminology. Please use your judgment when handling translations.
4. Ensure consistency in the translations.
5. Review the translations in the JSON files to understand the big picture and the overall nuances.
6. Make sure the translations are accurate and make sense in context. They should accurately reflect UI nuances with a strong focus on contextual accuracy.
7. When updating existing JSON files, check against the `_new_strings.md` file for new strings.

Regarding the locale JSON files:

1. Translate all the strings in the JSON files according to my instructions.
2. Ensure that the JSON files are valid and have good formatting.
3. Ensure that there are no repeated strings in the JSON files. Perform a final check after updating the JSON files.
